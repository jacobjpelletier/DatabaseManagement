# Data Management and Business Process Modeling Course Project

## Overview

This repository showcases the work completed as part of Data Management and Business Process Modeling course project, aimed at applying business modelling and database design management principles in a real-world business simulation. The project is divided into six sprints.

## Project Structure

This project is broken down into six sprints, each focused on different aspects of operations management and factory optimization. The following sections outline each sprint and its deliverable:

### Sprint 1: Logical Entity Relationship (ER) Model
- **Deliverable**: A PDF containing the logical entity relationship diagram (ERD) that includes a minimum of 8 entities, their relationships, and attributes. This ERD serves as the foundation for the physical database structure in later sprints.
- **Key Focus**: Identify entities, attributes, and relationships while explaining data connections and examples of how data will be stored.

### Sprint 2: Physical ER Model
- **Deliverable**: A physical ERD that includes enhanced entity constructs, complete relationships, foreign keys (FK), and primary keys (PK). The ERD must be adjusted to include any necessary subtypes and ensure that all relationships, including many-to-many, are resolved.
- **Key Focus**: Implementing enhanced entities, correct PK/FK use, and addressing data types.

### Sprint 3: Database Schema (DDL Script)
- **Deliverable**: The Data Definition Language (DDL) script that creates the database tables and constraints based on the physical ERD. This includes creating tables, setting up constraints, and adding checks and unique constraints.
- **Key Focus**: Translating the ERD into a functioning database schema.

### Sprint 4: Data Population
- **Deliverable**: Populated database tables with a minimum of 30 records in each strong entity and at least 10 records in subtypes and associative entities.
- **Key Focus**: Inputting sample data to validate the database schema and prepare for report generation.

### Sprint 5: Report Generation (3 Reports)
- **Deliverable**: SQL queries for three reports, including the code, an explanation of the report's purpose, and screenshots of the results.
- **Key Focus**: Generating business insights from the data through advanced SQL queries.

### Sprint 6: Final Presentation & Remaining Reports
- **Deliverable**: A 15-minute recorded presentation showcasing the complete project. This includes the final two reports, live SQL query demonstrations, and a review of project challenges and recommendations.
- **Key Focus**: Presenting the overall project, demonstrating key insights, and reflecting on challenges and improvements.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MariaDB
- **Admin Tool**: DBeaver
